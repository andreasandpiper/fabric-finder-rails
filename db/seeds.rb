# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# images = ["https://d2d00szk9na1qq.cloudfront.net/Product/86c0f0b0-de8d-43bd-a893-b91454f9e7bc/Images/Large_0421216.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91PMXeJneRL._SY355_.jpg","https://media.rainpos.com/674/image_20170124221310.jpeg"]
